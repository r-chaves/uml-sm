# uml-sm
A tool for expressing, parsing, and processing UML state machines.

# Summary
I have heavily used State machine-based designs in my career as an embedded software developer. Along the way, I have encountered and used a number of different tools for expressing them and executing them. Expressive (design) tools are things like Visio, Enterprise Architect, and PlantUML. Execution tools are libraries or frameworks that provide an engine for executing state machine semantics on a model implemented within the framework.

The intent of this project is to develop a tool that addresses some needs I have identified through my use of the tools listed above. I'm developing it as an open source project in order to share with the larger community.

# Goals
I would like to end up with something that can be used by software developers to express state machines with minimal effort and then have the capability to do several things with the model, such as:
1. Test it
2. Generate code from it

# Next steps
Stay tuned for updates and look at the Project and Issues board to see what I'm currently working on.
